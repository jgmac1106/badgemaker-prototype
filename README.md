This is a badge maker app that was started around the end of March
2012.

I am trying to remove the baked in assertions and develop a badging platform I can own from my domain. That's my assertion. A badge from me, comes with the endorsement of my name behind my url.

The badgemaker app will produce an HTML file pre-populated with the correct microformats for a reply post. There will be fields for the recipient of the badge and a link to evidence. These fields will be populated when a url is parsed by the badge issuer.

The current badgemaker is set up for Open Badges 1.0 spec. The goal of this project is to see if webmentions provide a similar functionality but that would be simple for anyone to deploy.

None of this code should ever be used. This is just a scratch space. You would, for example, never expose database usernames and passwords. Long term we hope to add IndieLogin functionality.

I hope to allow people to make a branch using whatever language they want. I am starting myself with node.js and php, though I a master, or even a novice of either.

All the SVG art in this project is by [Jessica Klein][].
